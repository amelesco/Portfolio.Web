 📜Description 
This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website.
It's a project I built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase my front-end development skills and learning journey.

🦾Motivation & Problem Solved
The primary motivation behind this project was to serve as a hands-on challenge to apply and solidify the foundational web development concepts learned during my self-directed study. Building it from the ground up was a significant undertaking, but a deeply rewarding one that allowed me to solve real-world coding problems.

✅Through this process, I understand.
How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact cohesively to create a complete and dynamic web experience.
Practical Git and GitHub for version control, collaboration, and project management.
The essential steps involved in deploying a website to make it accessible online.
Initial concepts of JavaScript optimization for writing cleaner and more efficient code.
While I'm continuously learning and currently just starting my journey with React, this project was fundamental in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, reinforcing my core front-end understanding.
